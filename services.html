<p><b>What is a piece of text?
A text is a passage of words that conveys a set of meanings to the person who is reading it. It’s a body of written work, in various forms and structures, that can be words, phrases and sentences that piece together a passage of written work.

To put it as simply as possible, it is a group of words. But it can come in many different forms.

A text can be written materials, such as books, magazines, newspapers, or online content. But it can also be other things, those that we may not associate with standard text. Text could be movies, scripts, paintings, songs, political cartoons, advertisements and maps. If we can look at something with words and sentences, explore it, find layers of meaning in it, and draw information and conclusions from it, you’re looking at a text.

Examples of a text
As noted above, a text can take many forms and it can be seen within different types of work.

These are just some of the examples of types of different texts:

Books
Scripts
Magazines
Newspapers
Instruction manuals
Cartoons with speech, and comics
Notes and references
Texts can be small or large, shot in content or long, winding novels. Passages of text can be seen in the above, and also found in a variety of different places. For example:

The safety information in an airplane
Ingredients on the back of a food product
Contents of a letter or email
A text message from a friend
The contents of a shopping list
Essentially, text is seen everywhere — passages and groupings of written word — and can be short or long, coming in vastly different forms.
